			    <p>I care about the communities we call home and believe we should each do our part to shape a future worthy of our children.  We have a duty to leave a legacy that honors our humanity.  I hope to contribute to that legacy as a judge who serves with compassion, integrity and fairness.</p>
			    <p>I’ve devoted my prosecutorial career to specialty courtrooms like domestic violence, elder abuse, delinquency, mental health, and child protection. I believe that we must seriously consider the success of problem-solving courts like drug courts, mental health courts and juvenile courts and build new justice models founded on restorative principles. I’m running for judge to support the efforts in making our court system more responsive to the public, victims and offenders alike, and to ensure our punishments serve a purpose in breaking the repeated cycles that plague our justice system.</p>

			    <p>As a prosecutor, I believe people should be held accountable for their actions, but I do not accept that people should live their lives defined by a single mistake that mars their future.  I believe defendants should have the opportunity to make amends and move on from their mistakes.</p> 
			    <p>As a prosecutor, I also believe victims are often disenfranchised by the court system.  As a judge, I would support the victim's bill of rights that is now guaranteed by the Illinois Constitution and ensure that victims feel welcomed into my courtroom.</p>
			    <p>I also recognize that no one is in court, civil or criminal, because things are going right in their life.  I believe that the court system should resolve the differences that bring litigants into court in such a way that all parties feel they have been treated with fairness and respect and that justice was done.</p>
			    <p>I also feel that the judiciary, like other branches of government, should be reflective of the people they serve. In Kane County, there are 14 Circuit Judges, but only one woman.  It is time for that to change.</p>
