			Why should I care about a judicial election?</button>

		<div id="Answer3" class="w3-panel w3-card w3-hide">
			<p>There are many reasons why you should care:
			<!--ul class="w3-ul"-->
			<ul>
				<li>You never know when you'll find yourself in front of a judge; most people don't choose to.</li>
				<li>Voting in a judicial election is the only time you'll actually have a say in who becomes a Circuit Judge</li>
				<li>If an associate judge wins an election to be a circuit judge, the circuit judges get to choose someome to fill the associate judge position</li>
				<li>Unqualified people frequently run for judge thinking that it is an easy job</li>
			</ul>
