		  		<h2>What do the bar association ratings mean?</h2>
		  	</div>
			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>Recommended ratings from the bar associations are not endorsements. A recommended rating is simply a statement from a professional organization regarding whether, in the opinion of the bar association (Kane County Bar Association) or in the opinion of their members (Illinois State Bar Association), the candidate meets the minimum qualifications for the job. I am proud to say I received recommended ratings from both the Kane County and Illinois State Bar Association (more info is available <a href="endorsements-evaluations.html">here</a>). My primary opponent is not presently recommended by either organization.</p>

				<h2>How do judicial campaigns differ from other political campaigns?</h2>
		  	</div>
			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>One major difference is that judicial candidates are required to follow the Code of Judicial Conduct. <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/sites/jib/Pages/Code.aspx#qst9">Rule 67: Canon 7</a> describes the inappropriate political activity from which judicial candidates must refrain.</p>
				<p>Judicial candidates are not allowed to make statements that appear to commit themselves with respect to issues that are likely to come before the court [A(3)(d)(i)] nor are they allowed to knowingly misrepresent the identity, qualifications, present position or other fact concerning themselves or their opponent(s) [A(3)(d)(ii)].</p>
				<p>Judicial candidates are also not allowed to “personally solicit or accept campaign contributions.” Instead they create campaign committees to do the fundraising for them [B(2)].</p>

				<h2>Do you have a history of supporting change within the justice system?</h2>

			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>In every assignment I’ve had, I’ve worked to make that courtroom better.  This is not an exhaustive list, but I have provided an example or two from most of the assignments I’ve had within the State’s Attorney’s Office to give you an idea of what has been important to me.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Abuse &amp Neglect Courtroom:  I was part of a team that created the Child Protection Mediation Program, so that parties in that courtroom had a safe space to address some of the concerns that arouse during the case that were outside of what could effectively be addressed in court.  I also regularly presented on Mandated Reporting and other community programs for how to keep your kids safe online and in the community.</li>
					<li>Juvenile Delinquency Unit:  I created the dual involved youth court call so that minors who were involved in multiple systems could be seen more holistically.  I also revived the Placement Evaluation Workgroup, which met monthly to discuss our highest risk, highest need youth.</li>
					<li>Community Prosecution Unit: I worked closely with community organizations in Aurora that were Weed &amp Seed communities and utilized my skills from public policy mediation, to work with neighborhood groups and the police department to start a dialogue to improve relations.  This was approximately 11 years ago, long before recent events that have highlighted this need.  I also created the Citizen’s Prosecutor Academy that let the public participate in a 10 week course about the justice system in Kane County.</li>
					<li>Elder Abuse Unit:  I was part of a group that created the Elder Fatality Review Team, which took legislation to create.  I also was a regular presenter in the community on how to keep yourself safe, scams to be aware of, and training first responders to recognize the signs of elder abuse.</li> 
					<li>Domestic Violence Unit: I moved the unit from using a typewriter for orders of protection to having computerized orders and helped trained first responders in best practices for handling domestic violence situations.</li>
					<li>Violations of Probation Unit:  My courtroom partner and I created a protocol for tracking the history of the case, the violations, and the consequences, so we could know at a glance how many violations there had been and what interventions had already been tried.</li>

				<h2>Why are you running as a Democrat?</h2>
		  	</div>
			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>I am running as a Democrat because I am one.  I believe that political candidates should be honest with voters.  This is especially important for judicial candidates who are seeking an office that is founded on fairness and integrity.  I feel that my platform is consistent with Democratic ideals.</p>
				
				<p>I also think that judicial races shouldn't be partisan.  When you are a judge, you are ruling based on the existing law, and one's political affiliation should not factor into judicial decisions or in how the judiciary views the people before it.</p>

		  	<div class="w3-panel w3-text-theme">
				<h2>Did you really vote in the Republican primary in 2016?</h2>
		  	</div>
			<div class="w3-container">
				<p>Yes. I was comfortable with the Democratic candidates but I had serious concerns about presidential candidates in the Republican primary.  I believe that one's values determine one's party affiliation, not which primary ballot they pull.  My values align with the Democratic party.  More info about my voting history can be found <a href="voting-history.html">here</a>.</p>
